> I am a big fan of anime and a regular user of [myanimelist.net](http://myanimelist.net/), but the design is very old. So I decided to make a  Redesign extension for the website. It's basically an extension/addon that override the default css with my custom css , add some UI functions with some Layout changes, to give website a modern look and feel.
